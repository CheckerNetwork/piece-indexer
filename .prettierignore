# We are using https://standardjs.com coding style. It is unfortunately incompatible with Prettier;
# see https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/996 and the linked issues.

# The goal of the configuration below is to configure Prettier to lint only Markdown files.
**/*.*
!**/*.md

# Let's keep LICENSE.md in the same formatting as we use in other PL repositories
LICENSE.md
